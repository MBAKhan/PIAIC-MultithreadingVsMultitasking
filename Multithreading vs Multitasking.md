# Multithreading vs Multitasking

> *Simply put, Multitasking is handling of different processes at the same time while Multithreading is handling multiple threads of the same process simultaneously.*

But it's not THAT simple to be honest!

## Examples:

When we are coding on our computers whilst listening to music and reading a blog post from our favourite blogger, we're actually **Multitasking**. But on the hand the our IDE i.e. Visual Studio for example is busy **Multithreading** because it is letting you enter new code, checking continuously for errors, and updating your code as you're saving it on the go.
